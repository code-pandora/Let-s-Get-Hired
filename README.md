# Let-s-Get-Hired
Design a Placement Preparation site. It should help students to know the eligibility criteria,
recruitment criteria and other details of all the companies which visited our University. It should
have a provision of Mock test specific to a particular company. Say TCS is visiting to our campus, so
complete information about company, its areas of working, location, recruitment criteria should be
available on site. Also, some tips given by already recruited seniors in this company should be there.
In Mock Test, if I select TCS, the type of questions with approx complexity which were asked in
written test should be asked, and user will able to access sample Interview Questions for
Technical,Managerial and HR round.


This is a group project made by team of  4 member's ( SWATI, HRITIKA, SONAM and SANGEETHA).
